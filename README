	This will, eventually, read
	a file containing IP addresses
	and (potentially) another ID
	field and perform a traceroute
	to each of the addresses, and
	record the hops and latency.

	Borrowing some in-py traceroute logic from http://github.com/leonidg.
	Currently performs very little, just setting a starting point.

	I have sodding well given up on 'borrowing' any other code for this.
	My own personal brand of horrible programming and unique bad practices are much easier
	to troubleshoot than trying to merge functions from disparate authors. Especially the old
	traceroute from '97. Egads. What _was_ I thinking?!

	We now accept a single addr from cliarg and successfully trace it. Working on threading this process now.

	Hah! It works. Handles exceptions, timeouts, and checks to validate received packets. It can even die atersending N probes with no response (orphaned probes). It's slow as the devil, though, as it is still single threaded. Threadpools come later, if at all.
